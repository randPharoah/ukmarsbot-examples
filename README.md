# ukmarsbot-examples
Sample code for the UKMARSBOT robot

These are (mostly) simple Arduino sketches that test or exercise parts of the UKMARSBOT hardware. They let you check that the various robot features are operating correctly and help you to understand how to use them. Along the way, you should learn some techniques that will help you learn how to write more complicated behaviours. You should be able to download each and run it in the Arduino IDE. 

At some point, there will probably be a UKMARSBOT library so that commmon code can be collected for ease of re-use.

## Getting Started
To use these examples without bothering with git and the github magic, cick the green "clone or download" button at the top right of the repository home page. You will see an option to download a zip file containing all the files in the repository. The file will be called 'ukmarsbot-examples-master.zip'

Unpack that file to a folder of your choosing. You should then be able to use the Arduino IDE to directly open each sketch and run it.

Don't just copy the individual files or their contents out into the Arduino IDE. Examples may contain additional files that need to be present in the same folder as the sketch in order for them to work.
