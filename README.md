# ukmarsbot-examples
Sample code for the UKMARSBOT robot

These are (mostly) simple Arduino sketches that test or exercise parts of the UKMARSBOT hardware. They let you check that the various robot features are operating correctly and help you to understand how to use them. Along the way, you should learn some techniques that will help you learn how to write more complicated behaviours. You should be able to download each and run it in the Arduino IDE. 

At some point, there will probably be a UKMARSBOT library so that commmon code can be collected for ease of re-use.
