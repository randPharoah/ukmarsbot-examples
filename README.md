# ukmarsbot-examples
sample code for the UKMARSBOT robot

These are (mostly) simple Arduino sketches that test or exercise art of the UKMARSBOT hardware. You should be able to download each and run it in the Arduino IDE. 

At some point, there will probably be a UKMARSBOT library so that commmon code can be collected for ease of re-use.
